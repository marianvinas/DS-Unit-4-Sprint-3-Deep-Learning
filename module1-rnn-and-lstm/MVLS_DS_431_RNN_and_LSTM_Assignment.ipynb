    "Note - Shakespeare wrote an awful lot. It's OK, especially initially, to sample/use smaller data and parameters, so you can have a tighter feedback loop when you're trying to get things running. Then, once you've got a proof of concept - start pushing it more!"

      "  TIMON. A mere satiety of commendations;\n",

      "  JEWELLER. My lord, 'tis rated\n",

      "  APEMANTUS. Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.\n",
      "  TIMON. Whither art going?\n",
      "  APEMANTUS. To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.\n",
      "  TIMON. That's a deed thou't die for.\n",
